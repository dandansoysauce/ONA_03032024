# Test App

This is a test app using Angular 17 as the Frontend and .NET Core 8 for the backend.

## Building the Frontend
```bash
$> cd CTestAppFrontned
$> npm install
$> npm start
```

This will run under `localhost:4200`.

## Building the Backend
```
$> cd CTestAppBackend
$> dotnet run
```

This will run under `localhost:5178` and will launch the Swagger page.

## Note
I wasn't able to initialize the git repository for the whole project before I started coding, that's why this repository has one big commit.
